# Day 11: Monkey in the Middle

Monkeys are playing "Keep Away" with your stuff.

They follow a logic to throw your items. They operate on
** how worried you are about each item**.

The rules for each monkey are as follows (input):
```text
Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 1:
  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74
  Operation: new = old + 6
  Test: divisible by 19
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 0

Monkey 2:
  Starting items: 79, 60, 97
  Operation: new = old * old
  Test: divisible by 13
    If true: throw to monkey 1
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 3:
  Starting items: 74
  Operation: new = old + 3
  Test: divisible by 17
    If true: throw to monkey 0
    If false: throw to monkey 1
```

Each monkey have several items.
- `Starting items`: lists your **worry level** and the order of inspection.
- `Operation`: shows how your worry level changes as that monkey inspects an item. For example: `new = old * 5`.
- `Test`: Shows how the monkey decides to throw the item.

1. **After each monkey inspects an item**
2. **object not damaged** => `round(worry level / 3)`.
3. **before it tests your worry level**

The monkey take turns inspecting and throwing.
```text
foreach $monkeys as $monkey
    foreach monkey.items as item
        inspect item
        throw item
```
Turn is for each monkey, round is for a complete "round" of turns for each monkey.

**When a monkey thows an item to another monkey it goes to the *end* of their items**.

Monkeys can receives items during the round, before the turns arrives to him.

If a monkey doesn't have items at the begining of his turn, the turn ends.

This is the evolution of the game in the first round:

```

After other rounds
```text

After round 2, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:

....


...

After round 15, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 83, 44, 8, 184, 9, 20, 26, 102
Monkey 1: 110, 36

Monkey 1: 245, 93, 53, 199, 115
Monkey 2: 
Monkey 3: 
```

The idea is to count the 2 most active monkeys how many times inspect items over 20 rounds.
```text
**Monkey 0 inspected items 101 times.**
Monkey 1 inspected items 95 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 7 times.
**Monkey 3 inspected items 105 times.**
```
Then return the *monkey business* level which is the multiplication: `10605`.

### Solution

The first approach is to get some [`yaml`](https://yaml.org/) package to read the rules of the monkeys, I found pretty easy install [symfony/yaml](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml.html) with composer. There is [some package](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.yaml.php) on pecl mentioned in the official docs of php, but it seems more difficult to work, and have some requirements on the system.

After consideration, the input is not a yaml file. So, it could be more easy to parse with Regex.
To unnistall packages with composer: `
There shold be a way to parse the data to a class that create the monkeys.
The class of the monkeys could be:

```
class Monkey
{
    int id;
    collection $items;
    public fn $operation;
    public fn $test;
}
```
