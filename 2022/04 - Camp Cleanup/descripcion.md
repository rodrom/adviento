# Day 4: Camp Cleanup

Every section of the camp to be clean up has an **unique id number**, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.

Some section assignments **overlap** between Elves. They create a **big list of the section assignments for each pair** (input).

For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:
```text
2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8
```
Some of the pairings show fully overlaping in the sections covered by both (4th and 5th line).

In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?
